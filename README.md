## Project Summary

This project investigates how weekday dynamics affect marketing campaign outcomes. The analysis focused on answering the following key questions:

### Key Questions:
1. **Which campaigns drive the highest number of sessions and user engagement?**
2. **Which campaigns perform best in terms of conversion rates and bounce rates?**
3. **How do engagement metrics vary between weekdays and weekends?**
4. **What are the primary traffic sources?**
5. **What is the relationship between user engagement and revenue?**


### Insights and Recommendations:
1. **Take successful strategies in Black Friday and Holiday to other campaigns for optimisation.**
2. **Enhance user experiences to increase session durations, particularly the 5â€“30 minute range.**
3. **Lower the bounce rate by improving page design and content relevance, among other things.**
4. **Make ad spending match times of highest engagement: for most, this is weekdays; for Black Friday, it's during weekends.**
5. **Rebuild New Year and Data Share Promo campaigns, considering their worst performance in ROI and conversion rates.**


These findings inform actionable recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies based on weekday trends.
